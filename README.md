# HorseDbClient


This (horse-themed 🐴) two-application project was 
an exercise in network programming with sockets. 
<a href="https://github.com/mkkekkonen/HorseDbServer">The server is here.</a>

The client was coded with with Windows Forms and C#. 

I framed the messages by using fixed-size variables 
and arrays in both endpoints.
